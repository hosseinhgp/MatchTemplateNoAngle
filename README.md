# MatchTemplateNoAngle
cv2 match template with no depend on angle

use matchtemplate method from cv2 package to find mathes with template picture, but this method can't fine template with deferent angle from orginal template, so we solve this by rotate template in Ø³pecific angle(for example 10). so this method can fine template with any direction and any angle.  

spermsample4 :  template sperm, because of rotation we set the first picture bigger than orginal sperm sample and after rotation we crop extra aria.
sperm1 : picture with number of template
